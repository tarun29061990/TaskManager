TaskManager
===========

A TaskManager which manages all your daily task. You can create a list and you can add items in a list. You can create multiple lists eg:- pending task, ongoing task, finished task, etc... You can edit items in a list and can drag and drop items within a list and across the lists. I will integrate it with mongoDB so that every user can have a track of all his tasks. For now, it is in a naive phase.

This is developed in native JavaScript with all love. Feel free to use it and make most of it. :)
